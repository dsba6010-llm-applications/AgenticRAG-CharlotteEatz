### 2. Local Deployment ⚙️
First, clone the repo like this:

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/dsba6010-llm-applications/AgenticRAG-CharlotteEatz.git
```

> [!WARNING]
> Our virtual environment was accidentally included in the initial push. It has since been removed from the repo but will be present in git history.
> Be sure to include ```--depth 1``` when cloning the repo to exclude git history and avoid downloading the virtual environment.

Then `cd` into the folder `AgenticRAG-CharlotteEatz`.  
Create a virtual environment, activate it, and install the dependencies.

```python
python3.10 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> [!TIP]
> If you're using Windows CMD, the 2nd line will be `.\venv\Scripts\activate.bat`. 
> Alternatively, if you're using Windows PowerShell, it would be `.\venv\Scripts\activate.ps1`
